    <p>Today, we’re excited to announce that we are open-sourcing Atom under the
<a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a>. We see Atom as a perfect complement to GitHub’s primary
mission of building better software by working together. Atom is a long-term
investment, and GitHub will continue to support its development with a dedicated
team going forward. But we also know that we can’t achieve our vision for Atom
alone. As Emacs and Vim have demonstrated over the past three decades, if you
want to build a thriving, long-lasting community around a text editor, it has to
be open source.</p>

<h2 id="whats-included">What’s included?</h2>

<p>Much of Atom’s functionality is provided by packages, and every Atom package has
been open source since the day we launched the beta. Today, we’re open sourcing
the rest of Atom, which includes the core application, Atom’s package manager,
and Atom’s Chromium-based desktop application framework, Atom Shell.</p>

<h3 id="atom-core">Atom Core</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/atom/atom">Atom’s core</a> contains the parts of the application that aren’t
provided by packages. This includes the build system, Atom’s global environment,
the workspace and panes, and the text editor component. Over time, we’ve
extracted functionality from Atom into libraries that can be used independently,
and we expect that process to continue.</p>

<h3 id="atom-package-manager">Atom Package Manager</h3>

<p>Atom’s package manager, <a href="https://github.com/atom/apm"><code class="highlighter-rouge">apm</code></a>, is a client library and command line
utility that facilitates publishing and installing Atom packages. <code class="highlighter-rouge">apm</code> is
currently powered by <code class="highlighter-rouge">atom.io</code>, but we plan on standardizing the backend APIs so
that eventually you can host your own registry.</p>

<h3 id="atom-shell">Atom Shell</h3>

<p>Finally, we’re just as excited to be open-sourcing <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom-shell">Atom Shell</a>
as we are about Atom itself. Over its 2.5 years of development, Atom has been
something of a hermit crab, beginning its life in a Cocoa <code class="highlighter-rouge">WebView</code>, then
migrating to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/">Chromium Embedded Framework</a>, and finally making its
permanent home inside Atom Shell. We experimented briefly with
<a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit">Node-Webkit</a>, but decided instead to hire <strong><a href="https://github.com/zcbenz">@zcbenz</a></strong> to
build the exact framework we were imagining.</p>

<p>We’ve taken great care to integrate Chromium and Node in a clean, maintainable
way, including sponsoring the addition of <a href="http://strongloop.com/strongblog/whats-new-node-js-v0-12-multiple-context-execution/">multi-context support</a>
in Node. We also created <a href="https://github.com/brightray/brightray">brightray</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/brightray/libchromiumcontent">libchromiumcontent</a>, which make it easier to embed Chromium
into native applications as a shared library.</p>

<h2 id="into-the-future">Into the future!</h2>

<p>There’s still a ton to do before Atom is ready for version 1.0. In the next few
months, we’ll be focusing on improving performance, releasing on Linux and
Windows, and stabilizing APIs. We think being open source will help us get there
faster, and more importantly, source access will give you the transparency and
control you’ve told us you expect from your tools.</p>

<p>We’d like to thank everyone who has participated in the Atom beta so far. Your
feedback, packages, and pull requests have been invaluable. We wouldn’t be
building a text editor if we didn’t plan on using it for the rest of our lives,
and we’re excited to take this critical step toward making that a reality.</p>
